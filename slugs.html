    <h2>Sea Sheep</h2>
    <h3>Costasiella kuroshimae</h3>
    <p>This leafy little guy is part of the family of Sacoglossans, which are mollusks and slugs that eat algae. What's interesting about this specific type of slug is that it's able to photosynthesize! It does this by retaining the chloroplasts from the food it eats. This process is known as kleptoplasty. In some cases, sea sheep can live on this process alone for months on end.</p>

    <h2>Spanish Dancer</h2>
    <h3>Hexabranchus sanguineus</h3>
    <p>This slug gets its name from its form, which looks like flowing red skirts of spanish dancers. It is one of the largest sea slugs, reaching roughly 40 centimeters long. Don't let it's elegant appearance fool you though! These slugs are venomous, and can shoot out an acid spray to ward off predators. </p>

 <h2>Neon Slug</h2>
 <h3>Nembrotha kubaryana</h3>
 <p>This colorful slug is often confused with its close relative, the Nembrotha cristata, whose body is decorated in teal spots. This slug's bright colors warn predators that it is toxic in a phenomenon known as aposematism. This slug can also produce toxins from its diet. </p>

    <h2>Sea Bunny</h2>
    <h3>Jorunna parva</h3>
    <p>This cute little guy gets its name from its fuzzy, rabbit-like appearance. Its body is covered in bunches of rods known as caryophyllidia. These rods are believed to be sensory organs of some sort, much like the two ear-like antennae.</p>

    <h2>Blue Dragon</h2>
    <h3>Glaucus Atlanticus</h3>
    <p>This beautiful creature is the deadliest sea slug on this list.It floats through the ocean, swallowing air bubbles to stay afloat, and its body is colored in such a way that it is camoflaged when seen from above or below. You can find these slugs munching on the tentacles of the Portuguese Man O'War, whose venom it can take and use as a weapon.</p>
